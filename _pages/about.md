<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a>, supervised by Professor <a href="https://luoyuyu.vip/">Yuyu Luo</a>. My current research interest focuses on **intelligent data visualization**.

My research aims to make data visualization more intelligent and accessible, enabling both experts and non-experts to effectively explore and understand complex data through advanced visualization techniques.
